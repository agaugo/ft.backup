/*
- Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
- Your function should return the line that was read.
- If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
- Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
- Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
- Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the get_next_line() function.
- Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file
